The competition will start on the weekend so i will not make any commits or write any code until the weekend. 
However i will take notes today on how im going to write the program.

The theme of this weeks competition is randomness, so i will make a card shuffler. however thats not very useful, so i will make a game out of it.

I chose medium because it shuffling a card is not neceserally hard. however im adding game dynamics to the project, UI and AI. So i consider this projects a medium difficulty project.

Technologies:
Language JS because i feel comfortable with it.
HTML/CSS maybe we'll use React for the UI, if it becomes too complicated, which i dont think it will.
Maybe we can add multi-player functionality instead of AI, that would be easier, maybe.  

the main file, where the main class lives...
the main class initialized everything and calls for the necessery functions to start. a better name than main
would be director class or orchetrator.
