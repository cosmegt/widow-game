# Widow Game
Widow is a 3+ player card game popular in Mexico.

# Game Instructions
## Goal
The goal of the game is to get the most valued poker hand on the table.

## Turn
Each player gets a turn, turns move clockwise. During your turn you can exchange only one card to the middle hand.

## The middle hand
In the middle of the game surface (where the game is being played) there is the middle hand, which owns 5 cards just like a player. A player can exchange one of the middle cards and add it to their own hand in exchange of a card from their own hand.

## Knock
Once a player feels comfortable with a strong pocker-hand they knock on the game surface letting know the rest of the players they can only exchange one of their cards for one more round before everyone shows their hands and the winner is revealed.

## Notes

The theme of this weeks competition is randomness, so i will make a card shuffler. however thats not very useful, so i will make a game out of it.

I chose medium because it shuffling a card is not neceserally hard. however im adding game dynamics to the project, UI and AI. So i consider this projects a medium difficulty project.

Technologies:
Language JS because i feel comfortable with it.
HTML/CSS maybe we'll use React for the UI, if it becomes too complicated, which i dont think it will.
Maybe we can add multi-player functionality instead of AI, that would be easier, maybe.
